## Notions and Syntax

I try to minimize technicalities in this book, but some is necessary.

In this section i walk through some basic concepts of programming and corresponding
terminology. Along this i introduce the pseudo-code syntax that i use in this book. This syntax
is Hasell-like but is not of a real-world programming language.

This is the least interesting chapter of this book.
