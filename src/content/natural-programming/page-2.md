I am an intermediate level Haskeller.

I graduated as a program designer mathematician. I worked as a software developer in the
industry for 9 years, mostly developing algorithms. I used mainly the C++, C# languages.

I was obsessed with programming language design and software coding methodologies
through my whole programming life. I tried many programming languages, because i kept
being not satisfied with any of them. I had a natural tendency toward functional programming.
Hence not surprisingly: my first satisfactory language was a functional one, ML. It was the one
where i first said to myself: 'Yes, this is how programming should be, this is a language and
standard library which is almost like if i designed it.' After falling into love with the functional style of programming, i discovered Haskell. First i hesitated to learn Haskell, for years, because it being lazy and purely functional incorrectly suggested to my lay past self that
Haskell is not for general purpose. Finally: the many praises that i read about it won over my
hesitation. Haskell was the programming environment which blew my mind and i finally felt
that i understand what programming is and my professional self found home in it.
