## Math

A little philosophy.

Low level programming involves optimization for program execution frugality. This is
something that mathematicians do not do. But as we go higher in level - we leave such
aspects of the program and instead concentrate more on the mathematical content of the
programming. High level programs are mathematical objects. Data is mathematical object,
relationships between data [like functions between input and output data] are mathematical
objects, .... Hence high level programming is defining mathematical objects, just what
mathematicians do. Hence high level programmers do not need a language other than the
language of math. Hence the right way to design a high level programming language is to just
provide the basic math concepts, as they are in math.

You may suspect that a trade-off exists between math and engineering, between theory and
practice, that closeness to math causes farness from engineering. But the opposite is the
case: because of the strong connection between programming and math: math-oriented
design generates higher practical usability than the object-oriented design.
