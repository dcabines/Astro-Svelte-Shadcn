# Natural Programming

**Author:** Zoltán Tóth.

Most programming languages used by the software industry are very badly designed. One
way of they being bad, for example, is that they are object-oriented, which, in statically typed
languages, is just stupidity. Problems in the programming languages spread to the usage
culture of the languages too. The coding culture problems, being habits, often persist even
after the root problem in the language is ceased.

The problem is caused by the designers of the programming languages being bad. In the
previous 5 decades the "expert"s who dominated programming language design and coding
styles were not really experts but were professional idiots. They were idiots in their
professions and they were professionals in "marketing" their idioticities, as they managed to
convince and mislead the whole software industry. This caused the software coding industry
to be several times less efficient.

The biggest problem in the situation is that neither the software coders nor the financial
decision makers are aware. The waking up is happening, it is obviously visible but is still slow.
Most people in the software coding industry still do not know what the industry misses. With
this book i try to raise attention to and show and explain the most important parts.
The bad quality of current programming languages and coding culture is well shown by Java,

C#, .... We have a single island of sanity in this ocean of idioticity, one language that is well-
designed and mature enough for wide-spread industrial usage - Haskell. Haskell is natural,

its design follows the 'lets do the right thing' attitude. Haskell is a concrete programming
language and it is also an attitude, a way of thinking. Modern Haskell-like languages also
include Agda, Idris, Lean, F*, which though are not mature products but rather only research
projects yet.

This book is for the average industrial software coder, who is already experienced in some
widely used statically typed language [C++, Java, C#, ...] and is open to the Haskell-like world
of software engineering. It is not a Haskell tutorial. Instead, it teaches concepts.
To gain full practical use of all the concepts in this book one has to use Haskell, but some of it
can be used in bad languages [like Java] too.
